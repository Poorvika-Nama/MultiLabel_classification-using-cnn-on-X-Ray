#  Multilabel Classification of Chest X-rays using CNN

This project applies deep learning for **multilabel classification** of chest X-ray images, enabling the automatic detection of multiple thoracic diseases from a single scan. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the model identifies co-occurring conditions ‚Äî an important step toward faster, more reliable clinical diagnostics.

##  Problem Statement

Unlike single-label classification tasks, medical imaging often involves multiple conditions appearing simultaneously. This project tackles the **multilabel classification** challenge using a CNN that outputs multiple binary predictions per image, allowing it to detect diseases like:

- Atelectasis  
- Cardiomegaly  
- Effusion  
- Infiltration  
- Pneumonia  
- Pneumothorax  
... and more.
